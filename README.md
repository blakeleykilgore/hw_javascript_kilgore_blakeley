###Resources:
* Lecture and Lecture Notes for the bulk of coding.
* http://www.w3schools.com for how to properly set up functions, including punctuation placement.
* Lauren Yockey helped me troubleshoot question 6.c.

###I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

###Comments:
For the most part, I did not have too much trouble working through this assignment. Writing and accessing arrays and objects makes sense. Working within and creating different branches also makes sense. The part where I am struggling is when it comes to functions. The difference between a declaration and an expression is pretty straightforward, however I am struggling to implement functions and understand completely how the different parts (ie parameters) work. That is why I was unable to completely finish question 6-c. Everything I worked through failed, and even with Lauren's help, I was not able to figure it out. The code I have was the one I thought made most sense: define what's being displayed, define what to display it with, and then put it all together.
